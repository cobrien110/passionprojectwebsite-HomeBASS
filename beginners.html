        <p>Don't worry, we all start somewhere. As with most things of this sort, there is usually going to be nothing better than in-person lessons with someone who actually knows how to teach. However, I learned entirely on my own and I know you can too. Just be warned that you may pick up a couple of bad habits on the road to perfection. However, there's is never turly a "wrong" way to play the bass. If you can get results with the way you play, then I encourage you to explore it. There's always time to fix things later if you want to. However, there are a couple of basic starting tips I can give you that will help you out greatly in the long term.</p>

            <p>As with learning anything new, there is one tip I can give you that, while it may sound obvious, will be very important for you to embody.<br><br><strong>Don't give up!</strong><br><br>When you start (assuming you are completly new to playing instruments), you're going to sound very bad. You're playing will be slow and your notes won't always sound the way you want them to. That's entirely okay. This is a process that will take many, many years to master and the best bassists out there today have been playing for very, very long times. Don't ever get discouraged. Look for the small bits of progress you make at the beginning. Given enough dedication, you will be able to play your favorite songs someday.</p>

        <h1>General Tips</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>Don't feel like you need to go out and buy the most expensive bass or amp when you're starting out. Cheap gear can sound good with the right audio setup. We'll go over this more in the Gear section of the site.</li>
            <li>When you first start, you'll need to build up callouses on your fingers. This will be a painful process for many people and you may develop blisters on your fingers. Don't feel bad about having to stop playing for the day if your fingers are giving you issues. I recommend band-aids to cover the blistered areas.</li>
            <li>Early on, try to use your pinky as much as possible. Speaking from experience, this can be a very difficult thing to get used to. It is important to be able to use the pinky for more complex lines and riffs and the sooner you get strength in your pinky the sooner you cna start trying these out.</li>
