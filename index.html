        <h1>About</h1>
        <p>Hi! My name is Cory O'Brien and I am the creator of this site and also the world's most mediocre bass player! That last part may or may not be true, but I do know that getting started with a new instrument can be tough, especially if it's something you've never tried before. With this site, I want to give you an appreciation for the bass guitar as well as some starting points that I would have loved to have known when I started. I'm entirely self-taught, and a part of that process was unlearning bad habits I tought myself. Hopefully, I'll be able to help you avoid those mistakes.</p>

        <p>I don't have any formal education, so you may have to take everything I say wih a grain of salt. However, I do have live-performance experience and I know what generally sounds good and what might be a little rough on the ears. Some of my practice tips may not work for you, but I'd encourage you to try them. You never know when trying something out of your comfort zone will end up doing you good in the long run.
